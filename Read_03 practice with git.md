#Version and the Cloud
1. **VCS**: version control system and that means you can:
   - revist various version of a file
   - track modifications or modifying indiviuals
   - compre a changes
1. **Local VCS** :the data that you saved it in your computer
1. **CVCS**: Centralized Version Control and i think it's like github but it's local
1. **DVCS**: Distributed Version Control :solved the problem when the server faile out ,DVCS allow you to make amirrored files 
## some of what i can do on git:
1. cd : swich directory
1. git add :change in the working directory to the staging area(staging area: when you do a git commit , git will take the changes 
that are in the staging area and make the new commit out of those changes)
1. git commit: its like snapshot of the project's currently staged changes
1. git clone: its lice copy file but from github accounts
1. git remote -v: to know the URL of file you work on it
1. git push origin master: uploading the changes to he cloud
